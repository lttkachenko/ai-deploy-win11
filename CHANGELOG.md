### Added
- (DOS-2) - Implemented a multi-zone RAG data architecture featuring strict context isolation between engineering and hobby knowledge bases.
- (DOS-2) - Created dual-watcher background daemon loops using independent `qdrant_watcher.py` instances to index separate host folders concurrently.
- (DOS-2) - Formulated isolated shortcode naming parameters to prevent context leakage across general LLM instances and targeted coding models.

### Fixed
- (DOS-2) - Resolved a critical HTTP 404 crash inside `qdrant_watcher.py` by mapping the target Ollama payload explicitly to the updated `/api/embed` endpoint.
- (DOS-2) - Fixed vector parsing exceptions by re-engineering the response interpreter to extract structured arrays from the modern `embeddings` JSON key.

### Added
- (DOS-1) - Integrated FastMCP python framework bindings inside WSL (`qdrant_mcp.py`) to expose real-time context injections to the Aider runtime agent via stdio transport channels.
- (DOS-1) - Added automated background persistence triggers for file-watchers by nesting execution commands inside the Windows Task Scheduler, bypassing local service permission blocks.
- (DOS-1) - Introduced automated model dependency evaluations using direct regex parsing maps against local YAML shortcode matrix configurations.

### Modified
- (DOS-1) - Overhauled the entire local deployment suite (`.ps1` / `.sh`), resolving hidden race conditions and lockups during network adapter port forwarding.
- (DOS-1) - Swapped out obsolete foundational model layers in Ollama and LiteLLM configurations for modern high-context MoE and Coder model architectures.
- (DOS-1) - Hardcoded LiteLLM gateway routines on the host to operate exclusively as a stealth Claude Sonnet API mimic layer for JetBrains IDE integrations.
